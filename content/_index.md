Hello!

This is my website!

Also...

# IT'S MY WEBSITE'S 1 YEAR ANNIVERSARY!!!

![](https://media1.tenor.com/m/2p58EvPRdN8AAAAC/robot-master-boss.gif)

I made this thingy for it, [be sure to check it out!](/fun/robot-master-maker)

Also, I suppose I can give you some things about myself:

### TLDR:

-   As of **[[Oct 5th, 2024]]**, I am 19 years old
-   I'm from Mexico and proud to be a [jarocho](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veracruz_(city)>)
-   I learnt English from _way too many_ Minecraft parody songs
    -   I do mean, _way too many_
        -   So much so that my youtube feed is permanently english flavored.
-   Mega Man nerd (only for classic & Battle Network saga tho)
-   Christian :\)
    -   **NOT A METHODIST** unlike what the personality quiz says. I'm evangelical.

Futher questioning can be made in the [about me](/about-me) section.

I also do my best to update this site frencuently, either from new blog posts or small fixes and tweaks I make, so enjoy my odd corner of the internet!
