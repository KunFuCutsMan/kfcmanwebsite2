Some months ago I coded a Pai Sho variant in to the [Skud Pai Sho website](https://skudpaisho.com/) (as of writing it's on the PR wall), so I've wanted to share my journey in to what it actually took to develop [Godai Pai Sho!]({{< param godaiRules >}})

If anyone that is from the discord server is reading this, then these posts will hopefully be a guide to develop your own game and avoid many head scratchers and sleepless nights üòÅ
