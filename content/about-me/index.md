# About Me

Well, hello! I'm Kun Fu Cuts Man (or KFCMan for short) \
As of writing this I am an 18 year old from Mexico who wants to be a Mechatronics Engineer.

## FAQs that I thought you would ask, in no particular order

**Why is your username KunFuCutsMan?**

So around 2019 I joined the [Mega Man Maker community](https://megamanmaker.com/); back then most common comunication method were the now extint forums, therefore little me thought I needed a new cool username for being there.

I wanted to have a username that would be a pun on whatever avatar I would use, and my first username was... [drumroll please] _Lil' Pump Man_. Yeah it wasn't great. I wanted to have an avatar of a tiny Pump Man from Mega Man 10 next to a normal sized Rockman. And because I needed to _also_ make the avatar I needed to accompany this joke username, it wasn't worth it.

After watching a [video](https://youtu.be/Sv3pS_0vFjA?si=R0LA-JsLQKYu2Te_) from Vinesauce, I got the idea of my current username: **Kun Fu Cuts Man!**

...Also the short version of my username is KFCMan. The association with the food brand was not intentional and it was only noticed thanks to someone on the community.
