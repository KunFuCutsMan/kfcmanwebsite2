I've also enjoyed been enjoying some facfiction/indie-reads {{< small >}}(is that a real term?){{< /small >}} stuff, some that I can remember:

-   [Broccoli Soup!](https://www.webtoons.com/en/canvas/broccoli-soup/list?title_no=625936): Webtoon that talks about the relationship between a creator and their creation and how you grow attached to them :D
-   [Empyrean-iris-story-collection](https://www.wattpad.com/story/222258444-empyrean-iris-story-collection): 200 chapters of human bulshittery and drama; each arc varies from tone to tone as we learn _how messed up humanity is. In a fun way._ {{< small >}}I am not mentally prepared to read the other 3 volumes.{{< /small >}}
-   [Welcome to Doki Doki Literature Club Player!](https://archiveofourown.org/works/13334361): I learnt of this fic through searching through DDLC Mods and oh my it's great! Expect the unexpected as everything goes through hell and back (and a NSFW chapter)
-   And a collection of "What if [Persona Protagonist] had a shadow?
    -   [White Noise](https://archiveofourown.org/works/3689241): What if, instead of Yu Narukami having his persona, he instead almost became a victim of the events in Inaba?
    -   [Deconstructing me](https://archiveofourown.org/works/7067638): Yu Narukami hides stuff from his past. Does he regret his past actions and is now doing everything in an attempt to redeem himself? Find relationships?
    -   [Waning](https://archiveofourown.org/works/22357237): Mishima Yuuki got power tripped. It's now up the PTs to stop him. {{< small >}}The work isn't completed yet and probably won't be since it last got updated on January of 2021{{< /small >}}
    -   [Hospital of Guilt](https://archiveofourown.org/works/54623854): 17 years of holding one-self to past regrets hasn't gone well for Ryuji Sakamoto. Can his friends remind him that _he is not to blame?_
    -   [Theatre Of Fate](https://archiveofourown.org/works/52796179): A thought implanted itself within Ren Amamiya's mind. _Do people really want you?_

## Why are you Kun Fu Cuts Man?

So around 2019 I joined the [Mega Man Maker community](https://megamanmaker.com/); back then most common comunication method were the now extint forums, therefore little me thought I needed a new cool username for being there.

I wanted to have a username that would be a pun on whatever avatar I would use, and my first username was... [drumroll please] _Lil' Pump Man_. Yeah it wasn't great. I wanted to have an avatar of a tiny Pump Man from Mega Man 10 next to a normal sized Rockman. And because I needed to _also_ make the avatar I needed to accompany this joke username, it wasn't worth it.

After watching a [video](https://youtu.be/Sv3pS_0vFjA?si=R0LA-JsLQKYu2Te_) from Vinesauce, I got the idea of my current username: **Kun Fu Cuts Man!**

![asas](https://i.imgur.com/0uArQAJ.jpg "My first avatar as KunFuCutsMan. I didn't even bother editing this.")

...Also the short version of my username is KFCMan. The association with the food brand was not intentional and it was only noticed thanks to someone on the community.

## Why are you christian?

=======

> > > > > > > d8a2d7cdf8674a0d1387a1e57a7cd18cfeffa2fe

Ok so get ready for some backstory:

I went to a catholic elementary school from 4th to 9th grade (due to economic reasons they were the cheapest we could afford at the moment; they were part of a pious school system whose vision was to provide education to poor families, so thanks catholism!). I didn't really engaged in the church gatherings they would do about every 6 months _(and it was always about Job 1!)_; I more or less felt agnostic about the whole religion thing.

Then around when I entered high school my mom got invited to a house meeting and she became a christian, and a few weeks later my sister did. I, of course, was the latest to join in. It took me some weeks to even join the house meeting. I just simply stayed there and passed the time and didn't engage with what they were doing.

Six months later and we're hosting house meetings every friday, so that means _I'm not escaping from going to what I believed was some boring time :)))_. One time while I was half-hearing what was being preached, I was feeling sleepy when I suddenly heard a voice clearly saying to me "Acts. 11. 9."

I was in fact, very scared by the voice, freaked out I looked up the passage in the bible I was holding and found:

{{% cite "Acts 11 NIV" %}}
The voice spoke from heaven a second time, ‘Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.’
{{% /cite %}}

And that was the tipping point on my conversion story. It wasn't sudden at first, but the first seeds of Christianity were planted.

For the following six months I started watching youtube videos about Christianity, especifically about its veracity on what it teaches and what its bases are for starting. Channels like [Mike Winger](https://www.youtube.com/@MikeWinger), [InspiringPhilosophy](https://www.youtube.com/@InspiringPhilosophy), [The Beat](https://www.youtube.com/@thebeatagp) and [Mellisa Dougherty's](https://www.youtube.com/@MelissaDougherty) helped to understand that the cause of this faith _is true and actually did happen!_ Do you know how much evidence there is??? IT'S TOO MUCH!!! From archeological, philosophical to historical sources, everything you can think of is covered!

For a 50 minute summary of archealogical evidence for the ressurrection of Christ refer to [this video](https://youtu.be/P_68KfQFICg?si=ho9KmzA9C57g9tTc), and for a general overview series checkout [this playlist.](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1mr9ZTZb3TUYymBPce08oyuhnHLLkR_B&si=1X7vFiQU-6LClSvE)

About six months later I finally got the courage to accept Christ, I still remember the day I did, as I was sitting in the right section of my church when the calling for salvation got called.

It's been one funky journey ever since, but that's outside of the scope of this QnA
