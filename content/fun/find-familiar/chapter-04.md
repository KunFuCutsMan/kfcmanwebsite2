I could do nothing but watch my father and the others carry the injured men back to port; and analyzing the state of the ship it was a miracle it could even reach Laushore or even enter Odron Pral at all, not only were its masts ripped in half, but some parts of the bay and bow were missing. How The Moon Weaver managed to get here is beyond my imagination and my only possible answer to that is that a wizard did it. That was a terrible joke on my part.

It was close to midnight when everyone onboard were rescued from the wreckage; though I couldn’t tell if they had finished since the nearest lights to the site were those on port. There seemed to be some sort of reunion, as everyone who was still on their two feet gathered around a man of some sort of high importance and were dismissed for the night. Most seemed to stay before leaving shortly after.

I am standing next to a lamp post near the entrance to the docks and with whatever light is casted from above me I try to identify the men leaving the scene and entering Laushore, maybe my father is somewhere among them and I can welcome him with a surprise. After around twenty or so men pass near me a thought hits me.

I really only saw a figure carrying another before darkness hit and could only identify the bandana he was wearing on his forearm, then others joined the rescue mission and then nightfall welcomed Odran Pral. I had thought that man was my father, but what if he wasn’t? Where was he? Did he set foot on the docks before entering inside the broken vessel to grab someone else or was he one of the others that exited after the first figure? That’s assuming he was on the condition to attend the wound-

That’s assuming my father can carry a wounded sailor. Another thought strikes me. How do I know he’s in good condition? I can’t run to the ship and ask for a man named Jordan Dalzedi, they’d probably ignore me or not know between all the chaos of the incident. Is my father really here and-?

Stop Ellice, you’re going places you shouldn’t be thinking about, you can’t do anything about it and that-

Can’t do anything about it. Maybe he didn’t.

My mind begins to wander to the ocean and its endless expanse, somewhere out there someone must have noticed the clouds turning from a light gray to a dark blue hue, that someone must have also noticed lightning somewhere inside one of those clouds, and they must have noticed the growing billow of clouds approaching the ship.

And they must have alerted everyone of the incoming disaster.

Maybe it must have started out small. Just a few droplets of rain and more swaying than usual. Nothing too big, nothing too small to handle. Then it must have gone worse. More swaying, and a few loud cracks from the heavens above.

Nothing too big, nothing too small they could handle. Then with a lightning strike directed at the tallest point of the vessel, directed by the forces from above to the crow’s nest. Because of the situation no one must have been there. Maybe.

Then it must have gone worse. I feel something fall off my cheek. So must have fallen a part of the mast as everyone tied themselves to the ship before going to close the sails. I begin to imagine that my father must have offered himself to do the brave task, and slowly, he must have grabbed on for his dear life and then-

No. Stop. Don’t. Maybe, Maybe-

Why are you thinking about this Ellice?

Something is sliding off my face. Tears. Tears? Am I crying? I am. How long have I been like this? I try to help myself from making a mess but I can’t. Soon enough I’m holding on to the port’s fence so as to not fall on my knees. Maybe if my father were here I wouldn’t be such a mess. I’m a mess, aren’t I?

My shoulder feels heavy. I don’t know what’s causing it, but the weight moved from my shoulder to my back, and it’s doing circles slowly across it. I turn my head to my left and my teary eyes notice a figure standing next to me, leaned slightly over the dock’s fence, it is tall and stout, and due to the poor lighting I cannot recognize who that person is.

The figure then pulls me into a hug. I hadn’t had one of those ever since my father left, and this hug reminds me of the ones he gave me when I was younger. I lift my face to face the man and in a moment I finally recognize him. “-D-D-Dad!” That’s the only thing I can say before I break into more tears than I already was.

My years traveling all around the world; through land, sea, and weird semi-planes barely held together with magical artifacts and rope; had not prepared me for a shipwreck caused by a kraken while one of the worst storms of the decade raged upon a ship not meant for combat. Neither had they prepared me seeing my only daughter looking like she was about to break down at a moment’s notice.

After carrying Eawlus’ unconscious body off to someone competent enough in medicine. How the wizard had managed to cast that ritual despite the world falling around him I have no idea, but he saved our lives and I’ll have to buy him a drink for that.

I turn back to The Moon Weaver to recover any of my comrades who still have a chance of recovery. Dragash and Bor quickly joined me as we carried our less than healthy comrades off the town’s healers, who were now showing up to the scene.

Captain Kobelia was the last one to step foot on land, and thanked all of us for our coordination not only in handling the kraken incident, but the response for the injured as well. She also said our payment will be ready by tomorrow noon (which by the hour she probably meant by noon, but I can’t fight over semantics now) and that we’ll have a month or two to rest and recover.

I looked at The Moon Weaver one last time, the place that had been my life for two or three months couldn’t be recognized anymore, as whatever magic Eawlus conjured on her planks waned, and all that was left resembled a beaver’s dam. One day Ellice will be that powerful.

Speaking of her, I should probably go home now. She's probably fully awake despite the many times I’ve told her not to stay up waiting for me. I remember one time when she was eight where after we reunited she passed out in my arms from the lack of sleep she didn’t have from the previous days. Despite her claims the bags under her eyes said otherwise, she did promise to sleep regurarly after that incident.

Looking at the dimly lit dock I notice a figure with curly hair under a lamp post, and then realize Ellice has broken her sleep time promise, again. Old habits die hard, I suppose. I walk up to her expecting to run up to me like she usually does, but she doesn’t. Instead, she keeps staring at the remnants of The Moon Weaver.

Even when I am standing next to her she hasn’t even twitched an eye, and stays put like a statue. I hear a faint sniffle. Ellice was crying. At first it was faint, almost as if she moved some monster would get her, barely holding it together before she’d collapse on the floor.

Granted, I'm not the best when it comes to these types of situations, so taking note from my time with Frances, I gently placed my hand on Ellice’s back. I do not want to scare her or anything, I’m just letting her know there’s someone to accompany her on whatever she’s going through. Her shaking became calmer, and finally, she moved her head.

She slowly looked around her, as if trying to recognize where she was, before turning around to her left, to where I was standing. She was teary-eyed, and looked like she had been like this for a while. I hugged her the moment she faced me. “It’s okay, I’m here” I whispered.

“-D-D-Dad!”

“We’re here, and that’s what matters” I replied in another whisper. Ellice broke into more tears as we both stood next to the lamp post illuminating us.

Tomorrow morning, I have a due visit to Cyerne’s Shrine. Without her protection, our lives would have been much different from where we are now.
