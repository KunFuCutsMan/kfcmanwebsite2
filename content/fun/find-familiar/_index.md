Greetings! A few years ago I had a DnD phase that inspired me to write a story about a familiar summoning going sideways. These stories were originally meant for the [Tearose Library](https://www.roblox.com/games/3346338521/Tearose-Library) (previously named Teaful's Library), but I'll keep the original drafts (with minor corrections) here.
