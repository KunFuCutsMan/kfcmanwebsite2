Greetings! A few years ago I had a DnD phase that inspired me to write a story about a familiar summoning going sideways. These stories were originally meant for the [Tearose Library](https://www.roblox.com/games/3346338521/Tearose-Library) (previously named Teaful's Library), but I'll keep the original drafts (with _extremely_ minor corrections) here.

Due to reasons I had abandoned the roblox group and as such left the series on hiatus for almost four years, but now that I have come back and decided to upload another story (which you should see soon on this site), I decided "sure why not upload this on the internet too?"

Shoutout to all the folks at Tearose who give me feedback on these
