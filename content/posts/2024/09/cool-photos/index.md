Greetings! Tonight I wanted to do a quick post that's more or less a life update. Like the title of the page says I just wanted to share two photos I took.

Granted, they aren't the best since they were taken on a Samsung A6, but I wanted to save them before I deleted them because I think they'd make for good pixel art references.

The first one is this one, which I took while waiting for an order:

Now aside from the censored license plate for obvious reasons, the restaurant pictured is called **"Restaurante y Mariscos El Pulpo"** (Seafood Restaurant The Octopus), which is located right in front of an inverse archipelago that is located in Veracruz.

And by inverse archipelago, its what it is officially reffered to as; its a natural proctected zone that is charactized by concentrated masses of water in the middle of land, hence the name. There is one of them near my home actually, and it is located inside a valley depression that in turn makes the zone a nice zone to walk by.

I've always enjoyed the view the restaurant has, add to this the fresh air that hits the building from the lake, AND the view you get from being in the parking lot across the street, and it will always make you feel relaxed and connected to nature. At least that's how I feel every time I visit this place.

The second picture is this one, which was taken five days ago during my mom's birthday:

Is the photo shaky? Yes. Is the photo taken with a 4X zoom? Also yes. Was the view beatiful to look at? Absolutely.

Regarding the context of this photo: My family and I were celebrating my mom's birthday by going to a sushi restaurant in the boulevard area of Veracruz. We had lots of fun as my mom was trying to figure out how to use chopsticks after waiting almost an hour for our orders (granted, we order eight rolls in total and the staff wanted to deliver everything at once to keep us from waiting). In the evening we went to the plaza's viewpoint of the sea and saw the scene depicted.

Veracruz is a very important port for Mexico (it's the oldest in the Americas, of course it would be!) So we get tons of ships daily. The one depicted was going from south to north (right to left if viewed from where I stood), and above it was the full moon. Of course I needed to capture this scenario!

When I eventually picture this in pixel art, I'll just picture the center of the photo since the roofs of private condos is not ideal for the scene.

Anyway that's all I wanted to share today, I haven't been able to post many stuff because of school assignments, and what I _do_ want to write about would need some days to fully articulate.

And in case I don't see you today again, good morning, good evening and **_good night!_**
