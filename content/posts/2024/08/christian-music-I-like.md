Greetings! Today I wanted to share a small post with you, as other topics that I'd like to eventually cover in posts need to have a concrete idea first before I write about them.

So in no particular order I'll list any christian songs I like and why:

## The list itself

### Tumbas a Jardines - Maverick City Music (ft. Brandon Lake & Edgar Aguilar)

{{< youtube iQpVoxPDpHw >}}

Fun fact! My sister introduced me to this song when she went to another church, and I must say, I like the summer camp feel it has to it.

The lyrics talk about the work God has done thanks to the Holy Spirit, and the restoration it bring us, like planting gardens from graves (hey it's the title of the song!)

### Sí y Amén - Barak ft. Edward Rivera

{{< youtube 55X8QDneFOg >}}

This song is a big reminder of the power that God has, and the fact _the Lord of the Universe wants, and IS living with us._ I especially enjoy the final bridge (the one where "Sí y Amén" is repeated)

### Cuando estoy en Tu Presencia - New Wine

{{< youtube IHotPkYJmvE >}}

I must admit I enjoy when orchestras and many instruments are used for worship.

### El Rey Resucitado (Vivo Está) - New Wine

{{< youtube tQkbWSMT55s >}}

Isn't it weird that this song feels like one to play at the end of the world? And the fact that I like it because of that?

### Dios Incomparable - Generación 12 (ft. marcos Barrientos)

{{< youtube WmcSy89s9Ww >}}

Whenever I feel anxious I play this song.

### No hay lugar más alto - Miel San Marcos (ft. Christine D'clario)

{{< youtube 0oprwNnql94 >}}

Another lullaby like song!

### Día y Noche - New Wine

{{< youtube pAGXwDrKEKg >}}

Great use of voices as instruments of worship!
