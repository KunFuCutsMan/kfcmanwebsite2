That's right.

## It's raining in Veracruz.

It has rained non stop since yesterday and we've reached the 26 hour mark.

Half of the streets are flooding... somehow. \
Despite the fact we're a costal city it doesn't mean that areas of the city may be located in bowl-shaped areas or that the draining system doesn't work on other areas.
Especially not on the busiests streets.

I also had to go for a class this morning, which thankfully my mom decided to drop me off.

I also had to wait until noon to check if a class will happen or not.

As of writing this, the classroom is empty. And so is the entire campus.

I stayed in the library doing some homework and preparing some papers I need to print for statics, which are excersises for centroids and structure armors.
An IRL friend was also there so we stayed there.

That's everything I wanted to say, sorry if it's just a little rant; the rain appears to be calming now, so I could pick up a bus and go home.

Bye!
