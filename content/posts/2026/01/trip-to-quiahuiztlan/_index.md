Good morning everyone! Or afternoon, or evening. Whatever your timezone strikes at when you're reading this.

I wanted to narrate the events of a holiday I took on January 4th, Sunday. On sundays entrance to the site is free, so we booked it and went there first thing in the morning. It took around an hour to drive from Veracruz, and during the trip I took many photos I wanted to share.

## Quiahuiztlan: The place of the Rain

Oh, you don't know what Quiahuiztlan is? It's a very important site regarding the history of the end of Prehispanic Mexico and its following Conquest. You know what? I'm going to leave you with what was written on the site's information board, instead. It explains everything you need to know about the site.

All information was provided the **Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH)**

> Thanks to the archeological studies conducted at this site, we know that people of Totonac affiliation used to live here. As a defensive strategy, Quiahuiztlan was settled on the Bernal Hill, also called Cerro de los Metates. The constructors of the city used terraces to avoid the soil to slide down. At the same time, they introduced walls that worked as a defensive system, making it difficult for the invaders to access. Between A. D. 800 and 900 the Toltecs invaded the city and subjugated the inhabitants. At the beginning of the 13th century, the Aztecs also conquered the city.
>
> In Quiahuiztlan, mausoleum style tombs were found. These tombs have the shape of miniature temples and they were unique in ancient Mexico. The tombs are distributed in three main cemeteries. Some members of the nobility were buried in these tombs together with beautifully fashioned ceramic offerings.
>
> Quiahuiztlan is also famous due to the fact that during the journey of Cortés, a church and a fortified enclosure were built in the nearby lowlands and small hills. This place was called "Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz", and it is considered the first Spanish settlement in Mexico. In this place an alliance with the Europeans and 30 Totonacan towns was established. This fact facilitated, one way or another, the Conquest of Mexico.
>
> You are in an unique site. Besides the exceptional tombs and the astounding architecture in the middle of the hill, historical events of vital significance ocurred in this place. We invite you to experience this place, enjoy the natural environment, and help us protect it. This Cultural Heritage site belongs to all of us.

Because I have many images here, I'll split them in topical tabs for your convinience. Keep in mind any information I add here was from second-hand guides and complemented from the internet.

## The beach of Villa Rica

We also visited Villa Rica, which is just right next to Quiahuiztlan. We went to the beach, and had the excelent idea of _walking to La Quebrada._ It took us like 20 minutes to get there, and my sister got tired after all that walking. I don't think she had in mind just how much we had to walk.

From what I heard from tour guides, La Quebrada was the place Hernán Cortés took the sailors who did mutiny on him and wanted to return to Spain instead. Their punishments depended on their ranking, which included hanging, and mutilation of fingers and other parts. After he did this, he asked if any other members wanted to return home. No one wanted to return after that incident.

Now, you may be wondering why _La Quebrada_ is named like that. It's because of the rock formations that can be seen when you climb it. It's _broken,_ like if you split in two a geode and found its crystals inside. Look for yourself.

Also, the nuclear power plant Laguna Verde can be seen from the top. I didn't knew it was so close to Quiahuiztlan!

At the top, a stairway was made for you to descend to the formation itself. They were steep, so only I managed to climb down. Here's some of the pictures I took on my journey there.

Finally, huge shoutouts to this stick we found on the beach. It helped a LOT with walking, especially when climbing up and down _La Quebrada_.

That should be everything for today. Toodles!
