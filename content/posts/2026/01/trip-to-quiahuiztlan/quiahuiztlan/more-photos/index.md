Its not just tombs though, there are some other interesting spaces, like the ones I'll show in these pictures. ~Also because I want to include them but don't know where~

What intrigues more about the last photo is the fact these two tombs share different styles. One is primarilaly just rock and pebbles, while the second shares its style with the rest of the mausoleums. I believe the left one was made more recently, just at the end of Quiahuiztlan before it was abandoned.
