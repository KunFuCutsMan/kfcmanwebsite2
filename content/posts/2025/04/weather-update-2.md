Unlike what the gif says, it is **NOT** raining. The opposite in fact.

## It's blazing!

While it did rain some days ago (around the third week of march), Veracruz has been pretty hot right now. I've been having to use my parasol almost daily when going on my daily conmute around college, since most of my classes are in the morning and midday, and during that time is when the sun is heating up everything.

Thankfully tempetures lower after 2pm, and surprisingly tonight is relatively cool. Nice :)

Hi! Welcome to the third entry of [Weather Update!]({{< ref "tags/wheather-update" >}}) I've decided to formalize these types of posts into posts where I share the thoughts I've had over the week, that _could_ be shared with something like `status.cafe` but I'm too lazy to setup an account so you're recieving all of these in a single entry. How convinient!

Anyway, first stuff on the list: I got new glasses!

My glasses' frame got broken while I was cleaning them two days, so I had them replaced that same day, and I've recieved them yesterday. I can see better now.

My eyesight did get slightly worse from last year, but it turns out that I no longer have astigmatism, and only suffer from myopia, with a grade of 1.5 on each eye. That's not bad all, considering I've met people who at my age had grades of 5 and above.

Anyway, I chose a similar model to my previous case (a rectangular thick frame), but I decided to go with gray instead of black. I believe those types of frames fit my face the best, because from what I've read from glass aesthetics, the frame's shape has to contrast with your head shape; which in my case, they do. Another thing I've noticed is that these glasses are a lot confy, and that's possible because they're wider; the legs don't bend excesively to fit my eyesight.

Hello Future Me's video on [Apocalypses](https://youtu.be/ZbaSWX_Roko?si=_tELNu6ZRHKgTQvS) got me thinking that there's always a possibility that you won't experience something you'd _truly_ enjoy just because of the time period you are located in, and the technological advances around you. If I were in an apocalyptic setting and wouldn't have access yo technology, I'd no longer be able to enjoy videogames or the Mega Man Saga. That got me thinking, would someone from the 1800s had enjoyed Mega Man? Or videogames in general? You have to remember that people from _any_ time period are people like us (if not look up any time we found humor in historical pieces), so _stadisticly_ there was someone who would like videogames and was from the 1800s.

What stuff are we missing because they're not from our time period?

## The next day...

It's April 3rd Now. Some pals are trying to get to watch the Minecraft movie in some hours and I'm planning to go now. I'm going aswell, and _maybe_ later I'll write up my review of the movie.

That's it for today. I kinda forgot what other stuff to write since I started writing this one hour before going to sleep.

Good morning, good evening, and good night!
