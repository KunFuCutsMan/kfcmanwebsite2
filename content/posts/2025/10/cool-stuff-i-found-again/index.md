Hello! This blog post has nothing with any of my previous stuff posted here, so it gets a new tag! YAY! \
Say hello to... ["No tags I guess"](/tags/no-tags-i-guess)

It contains what it says on the label.

Moving on, this entry is dedicated to stuff I found during this month, or anything really.

## A hotel with a historical building in the middle

This hotel can be found in Veracruz' hotel area near the pier, especifically just inside the historical borders of the city. As such, due to its age, the little shack you see right there is considered historical, and cannot be torn down. Funny hotel shape ensues.

I could give a historical review of the city's history, but because I just want to share stuff with you I'll just link [Veracruz's wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veracruz_(city)#History)

## Bohemian Rhapsody but it's a mess

What it says on the label. Enjoy.

## Casio F-91W Easter Egg

Fun fact! If you have a F-91W Casio Clock, you can hold the bottom right button for the clock to display the company's name!

## Black Eyed Peas "The time (Dirty Bit)" Intro

It simply goes hard. You can see the rest of the video if you want. It _sort of_ predicted Pokemon Go. ~If you squint hard enough~

## Our house

It's where we like to sleep :)

## Train and truck

When going to college a few days ago, I decided to walk a bit whilst going in my usual bus route to college, so I took a bus that stops at the `$` symbol I placed on the map below this paragraph. Usually, buses that take Cuautemoc Av. cross the bridge and go on with their day. The bus I took that day takes a turn below the bridge, and goes between the train rails and a parking lot. That meant I had to walk.

Cuautemoc Av.'s bridge also has a bridge for walking, which is where I took this photo:

Once I did, I continued walking around the IMSS Hospital until I reached Miguel de Quevedo Av. I then continued straight until I reached ITVer's side entrance. It was a nice walk.

That would be all for today, good night!
