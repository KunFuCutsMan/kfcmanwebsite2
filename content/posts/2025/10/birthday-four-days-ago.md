Fun fact!

## My birthday was four days ago!

Second fun fact!

## I was too busy to write a birthday post!

Funny how things work out, because starting from October 5th my life has been very busy.

Here's a small rundown of what I've done this week:

- Go to church (very important thing to do on sundays)
- Eat at a shrimp buffet that belongs to one my mom's friend (very yummy)
- Get a birthday ice cream and brownie on said buffet (also very yummy)
- Have an oreo cheesecake for dinner (very yummy aswell, just don't eat more than two slices)
- Do many thermodynamics councilships (apparently I'm the only that understands how to work with tables)
- Get told a log needs to be delivered on thrusday (today)
- Work on said log (very busy)
- Finish said log and deliver it online
- Write this post before going to sleep (doing this atm)

So yes. I was busy.

## How's college?

Despite what I described earlier, it's going great! Mr. Aguerri has been speedying up his classes, and we're currently going through an exam week. Mr. Yanga is still Mr. Yanga, unfortunately. He _claims_ we're ready to move on to frecuency response, and he just dumped a lot of half-baked information with the hopes we figure it out.

_Not great,_ but I could still look up information from _somewhere_ at the library. I'll probably have to look at electronics books.

## How's your laptop?

It's broken.

We're getting a replacement in November.

You see, the problem lies with two coils thst were burnt in the motherboard. Since they're embedded directly on it, there's no way to replace them _unless_ we buy another motherboard. You can probably guess why that's a bad idea.

So we got an USB and told the repairman to move all of my files so that I don't loose them.

Good news is, because my mom has retired, she's not using her laptop anymore, so she lets me borrow it for any school work I need to do. I've already set up my chrome profile, and thanks to webapps I can work semi decently.

~Funny how her laptop, which is now a decade old, still runs and has outlived mine~

~Planned expirarion, I guess.~

## Final Thoughts

Time moves on.

I'm not saying it's a bad thing. Whatever you're going through will not happen forever.

You still have to mindful of your sorroundings, so don't slack.

I think that should be everything for today. Good night!
