Greetings! Haven't seen you since last year! I know it's a terrible joke, but I like its simplicity. It's even funnier when it is said after two weeks of New Year's Eve.

And I haven't written a full entry in (almost) two months, last one was in [november](/posts/2024/11/resting-finally) and it was also a "weather update" type of post {{< small >}}(Should I turn that into it's own tag? IDK){{< /small >}}. I had two other posts I wanted to publish but I didn't have the energy to finish them.

The first one was the fourth entry on the [Making a Pai Sho Capture Game series](/series/making-a-pai-sho-capture-game), where I was supposed to explain how to add tiles and their images, but documenting code is hard, and the simple task of "just place these images here and call it a day" gets conveluted once you have to figure out what code is relevant to that section. So that post has been sitting on the `/posts/2024/11` folder for a while now, untouched. Maybe I should review it again.

The other post, which was supposed to be posted in december, talked about how my family decorated our christmas tree, and how the decorations you put there were also a testament to our history together. As you can see by the lack of said post, it's also unfinished. And now I deleted it. So no december posts since I didn't have anything to talk about that month.

Now, where was I?

But that didn't mean that I left this site alone these pasts two months.

As you can see by the changelog, aside from the quick christmas css I did, I added support for RSS feeds, cleaned some folders and I added a new section! The [fun](/fun) section!

I'll put any stuff I made over there so I don't clog up the posts section. Originally I wanted to host a robot master maker experiment, but I didn't make much of it; right now that project is on the "unfinished side projects" pile; so after doing some CSS magic I published some old stories I wrote.

I wrote [Find Familiar](/fun/find-familiar) in 2021 because of two things:

1. I was in my DnD phase and really wanted to write something fantasy, and
2. Needed a way to cope with some feelings of loneliness I had back then.

That's right! \
_I have feelings!_ \
_Yaaaaayyyyyy..._

I think those feelins of loneliness still permeate in the first chapter. Reading it now it is clear that the main character, Ellice Dalzedi, was a standing for me; or at least how I felt during that time. At the start of the story, Ellice is a solitary bookworm with little family connections (it's implied that her only living relative is working off-country and as such she lives alone), has no real friends (yet), and her only company ends up being magical in nature.

Things get (somewhat) better for her as in the second chapter she _finally_ talks to someone in her classroom, though with the porpuse of helping with their homework. _Sound familiar?_
And let's not forget about the nightmare described in the _third chapter!_ That I think has enough juice for you to interprit on your own as ~~my~~ **_her_** fear of being geniune with **_someone._**

_Will anyone finally connect with that kid?_

Oops I got carried away.

Moving on...

I am writing a fourth chapter and leaving the series on a four year hiatus, and when I do I'll publish it here aswell. Ellice has good things for her coming.

I think this quiz result which I took a few weeks ago summarizes my point well:

{{% cite "[What emotion do you create from? Quiz by traumacure](https://uquiz.com/quiz/p0u5c3/what-emotion-do-you-create-from)" %}}
You create from hope. In spite of everything, you maintain a fervent hope deep inside you that things can always be better.
It is a stubborn and tenacious hope that you take care to cultivate because you would be lost without it. Art is an outlet for your hopes, a way of expressing your most optimistic wishes for the world.
It reveals your ideals and everything you value most.
Your work is a declaration of hope for yourself and the world, an adamant assertion that a better reality is within reach.
In a world so rife with disillusionment, you strive to send out a message of stubborn encouragement.
It is a call to action for everyone on the verge of giving up. Though you may doubt yourself at times, your hopes are what inspire you the most.

Also, I have [atopic dermatitis!](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atopic-dermatitis-eczema/symptoms-causes/syc-20353273)

You can read the report by yourself, but basically it means my skin is very sensitive because it is dry as a desert.

I discovered it because I needed a dermatologist's note for militar service to see if I was able to participate or not. As it turns out, I can. Previously I had been diagnosed with both [vitiligo](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vitiligo/symptoms-causes/syc-20355912) and [psoriasis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/psoriasis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355840), though those have been (mostly) contained. Long story short I have to apply sun blocker when going outside, using a special soap when showering and applying a cream after I'm dry. Also some pills.

Thinking about it, I haven't taken care of my skin at all and it's a surprise things haven't gone for the worse; aside from the fact that these lasts few months I had some pimples (they're gone now, thankfully). I do have many remnants of skin puntures, mosquito bites and scratches from childhoon and my tweens, so the symtomps of dermatitis do seem to match.

I think that's everything I wanted to say.

Take care of your skin.
