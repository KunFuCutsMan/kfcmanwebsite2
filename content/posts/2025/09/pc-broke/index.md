Hi!

I'm currently writing this blog post from my phone, on github's cloud workspace, which uses vscode. Honestly, I'm surprised you can use an IDE on mobile, even though the layout is the same as pc, but cropped for a phone.

right, speaking of which.

## My laptop broke

As you can see from the image above, my laptop's left hinge disconnected completely last friday. It was already broken, but it was manageable because nothing else had broke when using it. Until now.

With the hinge broken, it also pulled the cables that connected the main hardware to the laptop's monitor.

Which means I can't see the the contents inside.

~Oops~

I took it the same to a repair shop near my home, attended by a young man who seems to have studied CS in ITV before taking electronics and computer maintainance. I trust he can fix it so I can at least use a desktop computer instead of having to buy a new laptop. In that case I can save around $10,000 MXN, from the repair cost and buying the cheapest monitor, to having to purchase a laptop with similar characteristics.

Two days ago we managed to recover my files, so in case I truly need to switch, at least I don't have start from scratch :)

## Working mobile-only

I remember that during the pandemic, one of the biggest issues with students was not having enough devices for _everyone_ to attend virtual reunions, especially with families with many children. They had to either coordinate themselves to share s single computer, or use phones and work there. I never had this issue, my sister and mother had laptops of their own, and I used the same one I'm currently talking about, so we didn't have those issues.

I can now empathize with those who had to work exclusively with their phones.

### It's horrible experience

Remember those logs I talked about in [my previous post?](/posts/2025/09/weather-update-3) Yeah, I have to write them using Microsoft Word for mobile now. It's horrible.

You get only the most basic features of Word; formatting, tables, images, and... _drawing?_; but don't have acess to reference features like table of contents and image footers, so unless I use a pc from my college's computer lab, my recording will have to stay simple for now.

I saved those logs in the cloud, just in case.

I think that should be everything for now, until futher notice I'll only be able to write stuff (thanks GitHub Actions), but new pages will have to wait until I get my laptop back.

Cya!
