![Weather Update](https://media1.tenor.com/m/9iIWE93A0qgAAAAC/bill-wurtz-weather-update.gif)

Only on nights, though. It's been generally nice to sleep at night as long as I close my windows when rain comes. \
It's been also a refresher from the heat that has been going around all summer, which thankfully didn't affect me
as much because I stayed at home, didn't go to the beach like the _good jarocho I am._

Hello! As it turns out, I'm busy with college!

I haven't updated anything relevant on this site (even leaving a review for Terry Pratchet's The Color of Magic incomplete) because of one thing:

**I'm developing a mobile app!**

Long story short, the college calendar is somewhat different from elementary/basic education calendar; while both start on late August for students,
and a few weeks earlier for teachers, what they differ on are the holiday breaks: College students get ~~to enjoy~~ a month more of vacations
per break. That means that for the winter break, we get to enjoy mid-december AND all of January, and for summer, we get **_THREE MONTHS OF HOLIDAYS._**

It sounds crazy, right!

## BECAUSE IT IS!!!

And many of us loose _some_ sanity because of these breaks.

I mean, I'm glad I can rest after stresful work loads from learning, but maybe they give us _too many_ days to relax.

Most of my classmates decided to spend this time working and getting money for whatever a college student needs, and I started working on a
phone app which is called **AsesoriApp.**

Mind you, it probably won't be released to Play Store or something similar, it is only meant for use in the counceling program I'm in; which
also doubles as my social service when I finish giving enough councelings; and will be used to facilitate the process for assigning councelings
for students and us councelers.

### What's my tech stack?

Kotlin + Jetpack Compose for the phone app itself, and PHP with Laravel for the server. Pretty simple, and should be easy to adapt once I figure
out how deploying works.

> **Pro tip:** If you know PHP and need a backend server relatively quickly,
> use Laravel instead of writing everything from scratch. You're welcome.

I've also been using the power of EPUB files to read fanfics from A03, which means I don't have to be connected to the internet to read them.

Cool :)

Speaking of school, it's been going so good so far. I got to choose 5 classes, but because one of them is _Research Workshop,_ I have basically 4.

Problem is, I got _two of the worst teachers_ for two of them.

First is Mr. Aguerri.

He's old.

Maybe way too old, unfortunately. I don't like describing people by their age, as I see it as an insult when you _only_ describe someone by their age,
but I don't see any other way to describe him. A classmate of mine asked his summer job's boss if he knew the man, and claimed he was his teacher
_20 years ago,_ **_AND HE WAS STILL OLD!!!_** ~Mr. Aguerri is ancient.~

That also means that his classes are a _pain_ to go through, since he's covering only material from a book[^1], and he wants us
to _fully_ understand it. The contents? No. **EACH PARAGRAPH.**

**AND HE'S COVERING THREE PARAGRAPHS A DAY!!!**

## AND THAT'S NOT EVEN MENTIONING HIS TANGENTS, WHICH TAKE THE ENTIRE CLASS AND DON'T PROGRESS THROUGH NOTHING OF THE BOOK!!

He's also asking us for a log of everything covered. Thankfully the logs go by the book's subheadings, which is way better
than having to cover each paragraph individually.

Then there's also Mr. Yanga, who isn't as old as Mr. Aguerri, but still has problem with teaching style.

By the fact there is none.

He's supposed to be teaching us Analog Electronics, but during the first day he showed us a circuit involving a transistor, which we didn't
know it's use, and said this circuit could be used to get the Beta amplification factor of one, which he also didn't explain what is was.

Same thing has happened with the rest of our classes so far, **_and he's asking us for A WEEKLY LOG OF OUR NOTES?!?_** **_WHAT NOTES?!?!?_**

> Wikipedia my beloved, how could I have forsaken you

As you may have noticed, half of my classes involve writing some kind of log. So far I've been using Microsoft Word to make them, but I wanted to use
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write them down. I tried to set up Obsidian to compile several notes into a single exportable format,
but my attempts have failed so far.

Does anyone know how I could set up Obsidian for this to work? Working with markdown is easier than in Word, though both programs have the problem
of not having full support for diagrams, unless I export them as an SVG or an image. I say this because I use [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/)
to make my circuit diagrams, and I will also need some support to include those diagrams, math ecuations, and references if I need them.

So far Word has worked best for my use case, but if I could switch to markdown files, it would be appreciated.

I think that's everything I wanted to write for now, good night!
