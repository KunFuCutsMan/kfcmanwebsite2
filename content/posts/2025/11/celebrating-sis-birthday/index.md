That summary got you into clicking, right? ~Right?~

I've learn how to clickbait!! **MUAHAHAHA!!!**

For those who are worried, no my sister is not dying or anything... Rather... **She's going to DISNEYLAND PARIS!!!** For her 24th birthday she's gifting herself a trip to Paris via a traveling company from our city, and part of the planning trip includes Disneyland. It also means she _won't_ be with our family on her actual birthday.

## Too bad

Hence we've decided to celebrate it early before she takes off to the skies, so we decided to go this cafe that my mother found on facebook that is french themed. Though, it was more on the "french cafe on the center of Paris" type of cafe than one that sells actual french cousine. That's to be expected from cafes, since unlike cafeterias, they're focused on the drinks and coffees rather than the food.

That's the difference between cafeterias and cafes, btw.

Anyway, my sister ordered a hot cocoa and a "Croassant Cubo", and I ordered the same but with a frappé instead. I didn't know what to expect when I saw on the menu a "Croassant Cubo", because while I do know what a croassant is, I had no idea how to interpret the "Cubo" part. Was it some special type of serving I didn't know about that was common in France? If so, what did it look like?

Then the waiter brought the Croassant Cubos to our table and I was both surprised and dissapointed. The following is the one my sister ordered.

The "cubo" part of "Croassant Cubo" is simply "Cube", as in, the shape of the bread.

The one pictured is pistacho flavored, while I chose to eat the caramel Croassant Cubo. It was surprisingly hard on the exterior, but the interior was stuffed with chocolate, so overall it was good.

Also, it was my first trying out coffee. \
Not the drink. \
The beans themselves. \
They taste like coffee.

My frappe was decorated with some coffee beans which I'm sure were from [Bola de Oro](https://boladeoro.com.mx/), though I can't confirm. The best way I can describe the taste of and texture of eating coffee beans is that they're like peanuts but hollow, and the inside tastes like coffee. The taste stays in your mouth for 10 seconds before it dissapears. It was an interesing experience, to say the least.

I guess that's all I wanted to write about today. College work is still the same as I've explained in my [previous posts](/posts/2025/09/weather-update-3) so there's not much to talk about them besides they're getting done. I've also gotten a lot more councellings for diferential calculus because two weeks ago, the first graders were learning about limits and they needed help :)

It also means I got like 30+ hours for free, around 15% of the hours I need to free my social service.

It was a great choice to join PADIEER.

That should be everything for now. Good morning, good evening and _good night!
