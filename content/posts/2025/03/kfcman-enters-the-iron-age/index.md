Hey guess what!

## I'm still playing Minecraft

And I have died. A lot. Mainly because I needed iron to pass to the next stage of the game, but the caves that were nearby needed shields and armor for me to get to them.

So a lot has happened.

## TLDR

- I have a big cave next door (the type that was added in the Mountains Update)
- Tried to explore it but couldn't because it was filled with mobs and I was only armed with a stone axe.
- Only got some coal before I book it and go home
- Try again
- Die because of falling damage.
- Lose all of my stuff because I didn't place it in a chest

- Explore a bit
- Find another cave nearby which leads to a **SPIDER SPAWNER ON THE SURFACE** and a broken nether portal

On the portal I found a clock which I later lost in another mining session, but its presence will be remembered. On the way there I also found some iron.

Which I then used for a pickaxe. Which I lost in a mining session.

Fun fact: All the times I had lost my stuff was because of skeletons. Thank Mojang for adding shields.

## Back to the present

So after loosing all my stuff like three times I decided I had to take a break from mining and focus on another stuff, like...

### Building my base

From my previous [minecraft adventure post]({{< ref "posts/2025/02/how-do-i-craft-this-again#temporal-cave-shelters" >}}), I've been living under a rock, litterally. So I decided to do some base building in the mean time.

{{< tabs/wrapper >}}

{{% tabs/titles Name="base-improvements" %}}

- Chicken pens
- Chinampas and Pumpkin pies
- \.\.\.bees?

{{% tabs/tab title="Chicken pens" %}}

From the nearby savannah (which is actually just the next biome over, I can access it easily by paddiling on the river) I had found another mine and other stuff.

I brought some chickens from there and made myself a pen for them.

Right now their children are supplying me with tons of eggs, feathers for arrows and meat.

{{% tabs/tab title="Chinampas and Pumpkin pies" %}}

Since I needed food, I made some [chinampas](https://www.gob.mx/agricultura/es/articulos/la-agricultura-en-chinampas) where I could grow beetroot, pumpkins, melons and wheat on the river in front of my base.

>}}

It took a while for the stuff to grow, since I had only started with whatever I had found from the spider spawner from earlier, but now I have a nice supply of food.

Collecting some sugar cane from the river and conbining it with the pumpkin & melon chinampa I also have a steady supply of pumkin pies on my base.

{{% /tabs/tab %}}

{{% tabs/tab title="\.\.\.bees?" %}}

{{<figure

And because I had a plantation of trees in my backyard, _and_ a bed of flowers next to it, one of the trees decided to grow with a honeycomb next to it.

So I can't cut that tree anymore or the bees will get angry at me.

From the last tab you also see that I got enough iron to get myself a shield. I now feel a lot safer when traveling, because any arrows from skeletons can be easily deflected >:)

And that's everything I've done so far. There are other things like a small bridge, and some plans for moving my base to something more official to a grove, so I'll leave you with something that I haven't done since my first post.
