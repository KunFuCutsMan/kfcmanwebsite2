Just a heads up I am writing this while Malwarebytes is analyzing an USB my
sister gave me, so this is a lot more scattered than what I would normally write.

One year of blogging in this website, huh.

# AND ONLY PUBLISHED 20 POSTS?!??

## Huh????

### How????

That's around 0.6 posts published every months.

How much is that? Well...

![My current working directory for posts](./cwd-of-posts-directory.png)

This all are my posts, grouped by months, grouped by year. While in 2024 I did
write some stuff (usually 3 posts a month), I started slowing down this year
to the point of skipping may completely.

How do people write stuff? Constantly? **_FOR YEARS?_** Doesn't matter if its for
social media, internet posts or small ramblings, some people seem to have an easyness
to share their thoughts.

Mind you, those people fall within the end of the spectrum of blogging-ness. Most small
web devs like me share seem to not share everything online. I just looked at neocities'
[special sauce sites with the "blog" tag](https://neocities.org/browse?sort_by=special_sauce&tag=blog)
and they vary from posting every two days to every four months.

Maybe I shouldn't be so worried about blogging.

My posts are also a lot longer than avarage.

The other post I'm working on, about my thoughts on Terry Pratchet's Color of Magic is currently sitting
at 764 words, according to Github Copilot, and I'm not even done to a quarter of what I want to be at.

I guess that explains it.

I like to collect my thoughts first before sharing them.

Neat :)

Also the USB I was talking about hasn't finished analyzing.
