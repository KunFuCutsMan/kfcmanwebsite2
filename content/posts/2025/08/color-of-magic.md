Hello there.

I have written another blog post after a month of inactivity in this site. I do have an allibi though.

You see, I'm ~~single handely~~ helping develop a mobile app for the mentorship group and in at college.
That means that my time spent on my computer is spent on the repository on both the front-end and back-end
of the app, and not doing other stuff, like blogging.

It's been nice having my mind off having something to write, though. In my off time I've been reading some
books from [E-book Hunter](https://ebook-hunter.org/) ~(or just one + fanfics, to be more accurate)~, and
now that I finished **Terry Pratchett's The Color Of Magic** (aka **Discworld 01**).

That's right, I'm reading _all of Discworld, in order._ That won't bite me later down the line, will it?

## The plot(s) it(them)self(ves)

So the book starts with a prologue, actually, about both the irl history of Discworld, and the in-context
confirmation of the existence of the Discworld itself and the four elephants holding it AND the Great A'Tuin,
with the use of A GIANT CRANE BEING HELD WITH THOUSANDS OF SLAVES **_OVER THE EDGE OF THE WORLD._** This, along
with the explanation of the Big Bang hypothesis, I believe what make this a great introduction to the logic
of the series as a first time reader. Not only did I follow the logic this series follows (at least so far),
but also this prologue _also_ helps with a plot beat later.

> An alternative, favored by those of a religious, was that A'Tuin was crawling from the Birthplace to the Time
> of Mating, as were all the stars in the sky which were, obviously, also carried by giant turtles. When they
> arrived they would briefly and passionately mate, for the first and only time, and from that fiery union new
> turtles would be born to carry a new pattern of worlds. This was known as the Big Bang hypothesis.

### Chapter 1: The Color of Magic

After looking at the wikipedia article of this book, I have to agree that _The Color of Magic_ can be divided into
four stories, which while they do share the two recurring protagonists; **Rincewind**, the non-wizard wizard on
permanent home imprissoment, and **Twoflower**, the over-optimistic oblivious non-wizard who has no idea about his
adquisitive power; travel part of the Discworld to its ends and back.

This chapter is set during the retelling of the events of this story to two adventures, as told by Rincewind,
about the actions that lead to inevitable burning _and flooding_ of Ankh-Morpork. Funnily enough, these two guys are
betting which building was the one that exploded while eating deviled chicken.

It all started because _someone_ had the great idea of getting some well deserved holidays with the monetary equivalent
of bringing Taylor Swift's networth to Venezuela. That someone is Twoflower, of course. He also made the mistake
of not learning the local language, after wondering into the tavern Rincewind resides in and learning they can both
communicate via the Bre-Trobi language, Rincewind is offered a job as a tour guide. He accepts and inmidiately bails
with his pay of the day before being caught by the patriarch of city, who _politely forces_ him to Twoflower's guide,
or be the responsable for a possible war between the city and the Agatean Empire.

Twoflowers holidays start with him interrupting a tavern brawl to take photos of it. I do have to point out the funny
way this camera is described, as it is _literally_ controlled by a tiny homunculus who draws the image being taken
instead of how an actual camera works. The little guy even sometimes interacts with the two during the next chapter. \
During this part he also overvalues the tavern for fire insurance. That probably won't bite him later, will it?

So as it turns out, carrying a chest full of gold on a city full of criminals is a bad idea, and Twoflower gets kidnapped.
It is up to Rincewind to save him, gets in to trouble, some folks die and just as they escape, the tavern I mentioned
previously explodes. And burns. And so does the rest of the city in the process. If I'm honest I did kinda lost myself
on this chapter and only managed to recover during this part, which also coincides with the ending of this chapter.
It seems like the power of _reflected-sound-of-underground-spirits_ saved the two of them as the An kh-Morpock burns and
drowns at the same time.

Also this whole thing is actually a game (literally) played by the Discworld gods, with one named **The Lady** favoring
the pair of misadventurers. ~This will come important later~

### Chapter 2: Call of Cathulu

Did I mention the gods' play would be important later? That later is now, because while our company of non-wizards + photo
imp travel to their next destination, they suddenly encounter a **cave troll!**

![They have a cave troll](https://media1.tenor.com/m/oY1NOfYvSJsAAAAd/boromir-cave-troll.gif)

Being transported out of nowhere did left this particular cave troll particulary hot, and therefore very angry.
This is actually one of the few times where Rincewind steps up and doesn't let his cowardice drive him, and actually kills
the troll! [^1]

> \- The Color of Magic (Chapter 2: The Sending of Eight)

The troll encounter did cause a few things: first it separated Twoflower and Rincewind as their horses got scared and ran
into the forest nearby. Secondly, Twoflower alerted a pack of wolves, a mother bear, and a snake to his location. Third, he decides
to visit a hospitable home of a certain **Bel-Shamharoth**. And fourth, those same wolves, mother bear, and snake were alerted of
Rincewind's prescence, who is now currently at hanging on the branch of a tree. It is at this moment that he gets another visit
from Death[^2] who is simply waiting to reap _this slippery wizard._ The branch starts creaking, it pulls its bark comically
all the way down to the ground, and Rincewind is suddenly sucked up into a portal.

He's not dead this time.

As it turns out, the tree Rincewind (accidently) damaged because of his weight is the home of a colony of Dryads, who, because
of the irreperable damage he caused, demand the price be payed with his blood _unless_ Rincewind prooves he's a true wizard.

![Rincewind is not a wizard.](https://media1.tenor.com/m/WUVqyY-KBbAAAAAd/your-a-wizard-harry.gif)

The only spell Rincewind knows is a little spell from a book called The Octagon, which just so happens to be **_THE SPELL BOOK
WHO ALEDGEDLY WAS OWNED BY THE MAKER OF THE UNIVERSE_**, and **_IS THE REASON HE CANNOT LEARN OTHER SPELLS, BECUASE ITS SCARY
TO RESIDE IN THE SAME MIND THAT HAS A SPELL THAT COULD NUKE THE UNIVERSE_**, so he doesn't get to show his skills.

So before the driads take Rincewind's life (notice Death doesn't show up) the driads open a portal to watch Twoflower's current
wheabouts, who just so happens to be _deep inside_ Bel-Shamharoth's abode. Rincewind takes this opportunity to reunite with him,
and the two are now left on the _most dangerous temple that could exist._

> Bel-Shamharoth was the flip side of the coin of which Good and Evil are but one side.

> \- The Color of Magic (Chapter 2: The Sending of Eight)

Somewhere along these events we get introduced to my favorite chapter of the book: **Hrun the Barbarian.** Just read his description:

> There was no mistaking that shape. He’d seen it many times. The wide chest, the neck like a tree trunk, the surprisingly small
> head under its wild thatch of black hair looking like a tomato on a coffin... he could put a name to the creeping figure,
> and that name was Hrun the Barbarian.
>
> Hrun was one of the Circle Sea’s more durable heroes: a fighter of dragons, a despoiler of temples, a hired sword, the kingpost
> of every street brawl. He could even—and unlike many heroes of Rincewind’s acquaintance—speak words of more than two syllables,
> if given time and maybe a hint or two.

Hrun is the ultimate expression of a sword-and-spell adventurer, has gone through dozens of dungeons, is _absolutely covered_ in
gold, only wears a stolen liepard, and has a talking sword named **Kring**, who is my _second_ favorite character from the book.
He's a talking sword who has gone through so much stuff (mainly being stuck under a lake for 100 years), that he developed
some _slight_ attachment issues.

These two bring so much life in to the dynamic of _dumb and dumber_ that the non-wizards have, that the chapters were they
appear in (which unfortunately is only this one and next) were my favorite throught my reading experience. Hrun is a gentle
giant who is accostumed to the adventure life to the point he isn't phased by stuff that _should be weird[^3]_, and Kring
acts almost like a Wheatley, without the betray stuff, and is overall a pretty nice guy to talk to.

### Chapter 3: Here were dragons

### Chapter 4: The end is near, literally

## What did I think about the book?

Very funny

[1]: During Chapter 3 we will notice that Rincewind is more cowardly
[2]: Death also appeared during Twoflower's kidnapping last chapter, but I didn't mention him. According to Discworld lore,
he must collect any wizards' souls directly. That's the price of learning magic.
[3]: See Chapter 3
