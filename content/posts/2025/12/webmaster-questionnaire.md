After [Tofutush](https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-11-23.html) decided to do this questionnaire, I decided to do it myself. Eventually.

Oh boy.

~This is going to take a while~

ALso, the original questionnaire can be [found here](https://mouseling.net/100webmaster)

## 100 Questions for Webmasters

> 1\. Please introduce yourself.

Hello! I'm Kun Fu Cuts Man or KFCMan for short!

> 2\. How long have you been making websites?

Depends on the meaning of "website". I studied programming as a technical career in high school, and throught most of my time studying the main project was about creating a PHP website for a company my group invented. If my maths are correct, then I started learning PHP on 2021-2022ish.

> 3\. And what got you into the hobby?

Programming technical career! It started from my interest in programming in general, and making a website to call my own has been a project I've always wanted to make.

As it turns out, web development is the easiest way to do projects since all you need is a code editor, node and a browser.

> 4\. What kind of website are you most interested in?

I have two answers for this: gaming websites, and reading websites.

I remember playing on school computers and family laptops on websites like [friv](https://frivclassic.com/), [A10](https://www.a10.com/), [Nitrome](https://www.nitrome.com), and [Flipline Games](https://www.flipline.com/). Today I don't visit them as often as I used to, but they're still close to my heart.

I call reading websites the ones that involve a lot of reading to interact with them; the most prominent one being [Archive of our Own](http://archiveofourown.org/) and blogs. I love reading other peoples' lives!

> 5\. What's your workflow? Do you plan your websites out thoroughly or do you come up with the design as you go along?

It's a mix of both approaches. When I want to add something to my website, I imagine in my head what I want it to look like and simply, _do it._ If something is going to be repetitious then I make a system to facilite my process.

That's why I used Hugo to make a website where I mostly like write things :)

> 6\. Please link to your biggest inspirations.

...

...I don't have any direct inspirations.

Initial versions of my website were inspired by entrepeneur websites from 2022-2023 that used the latests trends from that time and [Flat Design](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Flat_Design), especially with the use of simple rectangles and readable layouts. I then threw a bit of [Frugier Metro](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Frutiger_Metro) for the colors and my website ended up existing.

> 7\. What's your favourite part about making websites?

Finding the solution to _that one thing_ that's been bothering me!

> 8\. And the thing you struggle with the most?

Keeping up with having a consistent blogging schedule, and having topics to talk about. How do people do it daily?

> 9\. Do you keep the same layout on all of your pages? Or do you use different ones?

Same layout of a `single-margin` and then some changes for whatever is needed. The most unique layouts I have are from my home page and the [fun section](/fun).

> 10\. How confident are you with CSS?

Medium confidence. I can definitively stand on my own (and some google searches) to create website without crazy effects.

> 11\. Do you know how to correctly use &lt;dl&gt;?

The what.

> 12\. What is your favourite HTML element?

The semantic brothers: `main`, `article`, `section`, `nav`, `aside` and `footer`.

> 13\. If you're making a new web page from scratch, what is the first thing you do?

Get an idea of what the page is going to look like.

> 14\. Do you know JavaScript?

Yes.

> 15\. How about PHP?

Yes.

> 16\. Does your website have a theme that you stick to?

I guess it follows the vague idea of a webmaster space loosely inspired by the Mega Man Battle Network computer spaces

> 17\. Are you more focused on content or design?

From the fact that my website is made using an SSG, I'd say content.

> 18\. Do you own a domain name? If not, would you ever want to?

Nope, I don't have the money for one yet.

I'd like a domain that uses my username, something like `kunfucutsm.an` would have been great if the [`.an` ccTLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.an) still existed.

> 19\. What do you think of nostalgia-focused or "retro" websites?

Good for them.

I wish they took readibility into account. ~And stopped using deprecated CSS like `float: left`~

> 20\. Is your HTML valid? Do you even check?

I think it is, though I haven't checked. Tabulations may not be as pretty as I'd like but hey it works.

> 21\. What are your opinion on buttons and banners?

I didn't know about buttons until I entered I entered neocities. They're a good idea! You can describe your website in a small image and learn about websites with actual poeple behind them! Because they designed _that button you just clicked!_

> 22\. What do you think of button walls in particular?

One of the downsides of having too many websites to show, everything becomes mushed together and you can't really tell what website is what.

> 23\. If you started over again, would you make something similar or completely different?

The only difference would probably be a glowing sphere that follows your cursor around in the background.

> 24\. Are you envious of other people's websites?

I don't think so? I haven't encountered any website that made me think "I want to STEAL that design! No one will ever know!"

Maybe [Leonel's website](https://roboticoperatingbuddy.neocities.org/).

> 25\. What text editor do you use?

Visual Studio Code + Lotus Theme.

> 26\. Why do you use that one?

VSCode is lightweight and easy to use. It also integrates with almost every tool with no difficulty.

> 27\. Do you host your image files on your web server, or on another host?

I host them on my own website, except for videos. I use [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) or Youtube if I need to share videos.

> 28\. This might not be relevant to you, but what's your opinion on the Neocities vs\. Nekoweb debate?

Haven't heard of it.

> 29\. How much server space would you estimate your main website takes up?

According to Neocities, as of December 2025, my website takes up 6.6 MB of space.

> 30\. Do you keep local backups of your files?

...Yes? Where do you think I got them from? _The internet?_

My website is actually managed via git and is hosted on [github](https://github.com/KunFuCutsMan/kfcmanwebsite2) if you want to check it out.

> 31\. Do you prefer simple or highly visual websites?

I prefer simple websites. Too many flashing colors and I feel like I'm going to vomit. Visual websites are great as long as you don't overwhelm the viewer.

> 32\. Do you stick to certain colours? Do you do that on purpose, or is it your subconscious?

As you may have noticed, I like orange, blue and grey.

They're also the main colors of my persona, KFCMan.

> 33\. Have you ever thought about quitting? Why?

I haven't considered it, though if it too distracting for me and my relationship with God then I'll have to take measures.

> 34\. Do you have many webmaster friends, or is it a solitary hobby?

It's a mostly solitary hobby, the only person I can consider a friend and a webmaster is Tofutush.

We chat on discord on ocassions :)

> 35\. Do people in your real life know about your website?

Some of my IRL college friends know about simply because the topic was brought up. Most of the time it ended with a "oh it's cool i guess" kind of reaction.

~:(~

> 36\. Do you update your website very often? How often is "very often"?

I usually update my website every 2-3 weeks on avarage to post something on my blog. Big updates come biannualy and CSS fixes whenever I see fit.

> 37\. And the overall design, do you change that much? Why or why not?

The basic layout has not changed that much, but what has changed _are the colors._

The first iteration of my website, which I never used because it was made with Svelte and didn't know how to export it at the time, had a white background and the glowing sphere I mentioned previously on Question 23. That design also included a much more complicated design of KFCMan, the sona, waving at the user that involved some CSS and Javascript to make it work.

That first design also was meant as a portfolio of sorts, and things were a lot more spaced out in accordance to Flat Design. It didn't left a lot left for other pages, and I didn't want it to be a single page, so the idea never took off.

Once I decided to make a blog, then the idea for the current grid look of my website came, and the rest is history.

Now that I write it, the overall design only changed once, and adjustments came later.

> 38\. Is your website more you-focused, hobby-focused, or outside world-focused?

From the fact it's a blog + show of things I like. Me focused.

> 39\. Do you do web design professionally?

Nope, and I don't think I will.

> 40\. If not, would you like to? And if you're comfortable answering, what do you do for work?

Some years ago I may have considered front-end development, but over the years I've learnt that the field it's not for me. It's just _too fast._ Back-end development seems like a more appetising choice than ever, if I have to work on something programming related.

> 41\. Do you communicate with people by email very much?

I don't use email other than to sign in to websites. The most I've ever communicated with someone via email is with the [christian webring](https://christian-webring.nekoweb.org/) administrators about a bug I found on their forums.

> 42\. Some people reject social media and use websites as a replacement\. Do you keep social media outside of your website?

I do! I use Whatsapp to talk with people near me, discord for anyone across a border, and facebook to learn about local information I need.

I don't use any other social media websites, except Youtube.

> 43\. How about instant messengers? Do you use a mainstream one like Discord or Telegram? Or something like Matrix? Do you avoid them?

I kinda answered this in the previous question. Moving on...

> 44\. Do you listen to music while you work on websites? If so, what kinds of artists?

I tend to listen to youtube videos as background noise. Topics tend to vary from christian youtubers, essays and engineering stuff.

> 45\. Do you keep everything you make on one website, or do you have more than one?

Everything is located right here :) \
~Eventually~

Github has my programming projects stored, too.

> 46\. On a similar note, do you keep to one topic on your site, or many?

I guess I keep several topics here, they're organized by [tags](/tags). Anything else that doesn't fit goes to the [fun section](/fun).

> 47\. Do you present your real self, or at least try? Or do you construct a persona on purpose?

I write how I write, and I speak how I speak, in English.

Those ramblings where I use all-caps sometimes do happen IRL, exactly in the same context where they happen in writing.

> 48\. Have you ever made a good friend thanks to your website?

Tofutush :)

Formal friendships negotiations are still underway.

> 49\. Are you happy with the way HTML and CSS currently work?

Yes. Especially now that it is truly mobile-friendly and there are no overlaps or weird wrappings.

> 50\. What are practices that you think people should avoid?

Using the `float` CSS attribute. Use `position: absolute` and `position: relative` instead, and you gain greater control for diverse enviroments.

> 51\. What about under-utilised practices, or things you think people should do more?

People should at least test their websites are ok with mobile screens! The developer tools from any browser allow you to check a view similar to a phone.

> 52\. Do you use a lot of semantic HTML? Or are you guilty of generic structure?

I love my semantic tags :)

> 53\. Do you consider different browsers?

I don't. I only have access to chrome and edge, so they're basically the same enviroment. Fortunately I only use CSS that's implemented everywhere so there shouldn't be a problem unless you're using Internet Explorer or Opera from a DSi.

> 54\. Speaking of, what's your preferred browser? Convince your readers why they should use it.

Chrome or Edge... That's a tough question.

Despite the hate it recieves, I think Edge is slightly better, because extensions there are generally easier to manage.

I'd recommend Brave if I'd use it.

> 55\. And what OS are you on?

Currently writing this (December 2024) from a Windows 10 laptop that belongs to my mom, that is synced to a remote enviroment on Chrome that runs Ubuntu.

Thanks Github :)

> 56\. Do you have a strong opinion on that, or do you just happen to use it?

I happen to use it. I don't have as many neccesity to do a customizable enviroment like Linux, and I don't think any programs I need for my degree _are_ in Linux.

> 57\. Are your websites mobile-friendly?

They are! All it took was using CSS Grid and presto!

> 58\. What are your thoughts on autoplay?

Please let me save my precious megabytes of internet :'(

> 59\. What are your thoughts on webrings? Are you in any?

Pretty good to know new people! Though large webrings mean you'll realisticly only meet the people around you.

> 60\. Do you have any web shrines? What do you like to see in that sort of page?

I don't, because I feel weird about their name. Shrine implies worship. Worship implies **_idols._** I know the etymological fallacy applies in that logic, as shrines are actually pages that show the interests of the webmaster regarding a particular topic, so it's cool to see them show up, especially when they're themed around that topic.

If I were to have a shrine page then it would probably be about [Pai Sho](https://skudpaisho.com/site/).

> 61\. Are your websites "cliche", in your opinion?

...Maybe? It isn't as chaotic as most of the websites on neocities are, but I like the organization.

> 62\. What is your ideal website? Are you striving for that, or for something else?

My ideal website would be the one that balances accesibility with creativity. You could easily navigate that website whilst looking at the pretty formatting the webmaster did.

As you can tell I follow the accesibility side of the balance.

> 63\. Are you an artist? Do you draw or design your own assets?

I'm not an artist, though I draw pixel art on occasions. All the pixel art assets you see on this website were made by me!

> 64\. What are your favourite resource sites?

...Wikipedia?

> 65\. Is there a habit you just can't get away from no matter how hard you try?

I'd prefer not to answer.

> 66\. What's your biggest advice for a new webmaster?

1. Know what you'll display to the world, and what to keep to yourself
2. Have a color scheme! It will help you with deciding how to paint your website.
3. Research what tools can help you create a website for your use case.
4. If your website is image heavy, use webp.
5. **NEVER** use Neocities' code editor. Use git and figure out how to upload it automaticly.

> 67\. Do you keep all your styling in CSS? Or do you hard-code some?

Everything is in stylesheets, and thanks to a Hugo partial I can call whatever stylesheet I need for a specific page.

> 68\. What do you think of frameset layouts?

Deprecated. Don't use it.

Same with `iframe`, they're so clunky to use, and any hyperlinks that are inside the frame _stay_ within the frame.

> 69\. How about table-based layouts?

Blessed are those who use table-based layouts, but they better use `grid`.

> 70\. Do you subscribe to the ideas of "one-column", "two-column" and "three-column" layouts? Do you use any of these?

Yes. It's practical and efficient. Have you seen my home page?

> 71\. Do you spend longer on the HTML or the CSS?

On the CSS. I like to make sure nothing breaks when I change screen sizes.

> 72\. Have you ever made a page with no CSS? It's useful for your thoughts.

Technically yes. My blog posts are written using markdown then transformed into HTML via templates. But I haven't done a website in pure HTML ever since I was a kid in fourth grade.

> 73\. Do you ever find yourself making layouts with nothing to put on them? Or do you only make layouts when the need arises?

I make layouts when the need arises. The most recent one as of writing was the scroll for the stories section of my website.

> 74\. Would you consider yourself a beginner? Or advanced? Somewhere in the middle?

Somewhere in the middle. I need to catch up to the latest best practices.

> 75\. Do you have a habit of looking at the source code of websites you visit?

Only when the website is impossible to navigate, or has annoying pop ups that need to be banished to The Shadow Realm:tm:

> 76\. How did YOU learn how to make websites?

I mentioned it before on question 2, I learnt HTML via my technical degree in programming. I also watched several youtube channel that talked about web development and went from there.

> 77\. Do you ever force elements to do things they're not supposed to?

There's a reason elements are desinated to work like that, and it's for the better. I see people use `div` and `span` for their layouts, but never have I seen a soul use `b` for _italics._

> 78\. Thoughts on floating elements?

Outdated. Use `position: absolute` and `position: relative` instead.

> 79\. When you're sizing stuff, what do you use first? Do you use px, em, %, or something else?

I primarily use `rem` for absolute sizes, and a conbination of `%` and `vdw` and `vdh` for relative sizes.

The exception are media queries; I still use `px` because it's easy to remember the sizes of phones and tables as `600px` and `720px` respectively.

> 80\. Do you have a favourite font?

I don't have a favorite font; but `sans serif` is my favorite font family.

> 81\. Would you run a website with another person? How would that work?

I guess if we both wanted the same domain we could work things out. Each person would get a subdirectory to work with, and the index page links to the subdirectory.

> 82\. Do you surf the Web to find new personal websites very often?

I wish I knew how to find more blogs with RSS feeds. I currently usually stay within the sites I follow on neocities and occasionally visit other indie sites.

> 83\. Do you bookmark other people's websites? How would you feel knowing someone else bookmarked yours?

Last time I bookmarked a website was in 2023 when I joined university. Guess what I bookmarked?

> 84\. What do you want people to be most impressed with when they see your website?

I honestly have no idea. I was going to say something generic but I retracted my answer.

> 85\. Are you interested in technology outside of websites? Do you collect?

I like plushies, especially the kind that is an object with a smiley face on it. I haven't invested in them because I don't have money, _yet._

> 86\. How often and for how long are you online?

Yes.

> 87\. When it comes to your website, who is your target audience?

To whoever reads this: **_YOU!_** \
_(grabs your throat and drags through your monitor)_

> 88\. Have you ever been interested in XHTML?

I'd prefer to keep working with HTML5 thank you.

> 89\. Do you program in general? Have you ever written a program for use with or on your website, not counting simple JavaScript?

Programming technical degree, so yes. Check out my github is you want to see my projects.

The most recent project for this website, as of time of writing, is Robot Master Maker for my 1 year anniversary.

> 90\. Speaking of programs that help you make websites, what do you think of static site generators (SSGs)? Have you ever used one?

I mean, I'm using Hugo to build this website.

They're great! Once you have a workflow then all you need to worry about is the content itself, and you can be sure there are no errors during templating.

The only downside of SSFs is that they assume how their templating system works and how content is handled.

> 91\. Do you keep a hitcounter? Why or why not?

The only hit counter I need is Neocities' hitcount.

> 92\. Do you frequent forums? Which ones?

I used to frecuent the Mega Man Maker forum until the hosting building burned down along with all the servers inside it. That was in 2019.

Rip MMM Forums.

> 93\. Do you write your page content directly into the editor, or do you prepare it elsewhere, like a text document or a Word document?

VSCode is good for writing. Both offsite and via virtual computers.

> 94\. Do you think you appear cool to others? A more accurate answer now: do other people ever say you're cool?

Haven't heard anyone say it

~:(~

> 95\. Are you embarrassed of your old work? Have you ever deleted everything out of shame?

Nope, they were a good opportunity to learn.

Good finding something online though.

> 96\. Would you close down your website if you couldn't update it, or would you leave an archive?

Seeing as neocities doesn't have a problem with inactive wensites, I'd leave it as it is.

The final update would be of the homepage, explaining why I couldn't maintain my website anymore.

> 97\. Do you reveal a lot about yourself on your website? Or are you more secretive?

I'd say somewhat secretive, though I think I've left enough details about me, so it cancels out.

> 98\. Are you willing to reveal who your best online friend is, and/or if they have a website?

Tofutush. Linked before I started the questionnair.

> 99\. And do you optimise the images on your website?

Hugo transforms anything inside a custom `figure` shortcode that does the following:

1. If the image's URL is absolute, simply hotlink it
2. If the image is linked relatively, in relation to the markdown file, then it's a local image:
  a) Load the image
  b) Decide what kind of compressing to do, as what was given to the shortcode
  c) If the image is tall, resize it to 500px
  d) Transform the image to webp, and link the transformed image instead.

And now each image is 100kb each!

> 100\. We're out of time! How do you feel after answering 100 questions? ....other than exhausted.

Exhausted.

And glad.

This is over.

If any of you want to this quiz.

**DO NOT DO IT IN A SINGLE SESSION!**

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
