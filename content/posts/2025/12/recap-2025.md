Hello!

**Merry Christmas!**

Also happy New Year if you're reading this in 2026 onwards.

## Why post now

Well, I am sort of restless.

Christmas celebrations came and went and it wasn't as grandiose as other people celebrate.

My mom decided to buy dinner from a restaurant that sells chamorros (basically prepared pork) due to the 24th, we had it after church service (because church services _never stop_), and went to bed early. Not sure how much my parents stayed up, but I did until 11pm because I couldn't sleep.

Speaking of which, my sleep schedule has shifted to 10:30pm to 11pm onwards. Fortunately because I'm on holidays until _february,_ I won't have to worry about that for now.

We haven't gone to many places, and probably our routine will stay that way for a while. In the mean time, I've been on my mom's laptop handling this website and whatever I can on the mobile app I've kept mentioning in some of these posts. Development of that has been on hiatus because the main developer, which just so happens to be me, didn't have access to a computer suitable for programming.

Thankfully Github provides edge computing, so I can at least keep writing posts for this website, and now start finishing the backend server. Did you know each digital enviroment has some tools already installed? I didn't until a few days ago, so I only had to install Laravel on the virtual enviroment for the server.

~Where was I? Ah, right...~

Boredom.

I'm bored and should probably go out more.

I know how to ride buses.

I know where I want to go.

Now I only need the iniciative.

Enough brooding! This post is about reflecting! Both good and bad!

## About this website

Honestly? I've felt blessed regarding this website.

Slowly I've been getting to know people from across the world, even if just from what they decide to show on their websites, and _somehow_ I've been able to dodge all the drama that has come on the indie web space.

Indie web has not replaced social media, it probably never will. I don't share the sentiment of people who have abandoned _all_ social media in favor of simply staying on their website. I understand their reason, but if you are going to keep in touch with reality in your local sphere, you have to use social media wether you like it or not.

I ran out of writing juice. I'll see you next year for blog posting!

Next on the line, Hugo tutorials.
