You get online and the world forms 'round you \
It's been a while, haven't played since ~~point 2~~ _xbox 360 edition, TU43!_ \
You break a smile, 'cause you've almost forgot to mine \
It's just been such a long time! \
\
I'm all alone... Asking! \
How do I craft this again? (Oh oh oh oh) \
How do I craft this again? (Oh oh oh oh) \
I wanna know... How do I craft this again?!

## Fun fact!

I was a minecraft kid! {{%small%}}_Shockers!_{{%/small%}}

Yesterday I downloaded TLauncher. Why? Because I wanted to.

Honestly I didn't know it was that easy to download Minecraft, I believed it had you had to pay like any other game, but no! Launchers are free to use!

So after setting up my account and submitting a skin I made months earlier, I present to you...

## KFCMan's First Day in Minecraft 1.21.4

I downloaded the latest version with Optifine (because I do not wanna turn my laptop into an electric furnace) and quickly checked the default controls. They were surprisingly good to use despite me being left-handed (I had to switch to a right-side mouse to play, obviously)

I then created a new world in survival normal mode, and called it "Mundo Nuevo"

I spawned on a birch tree next to this cool waterfall which you will now see in the following screenshot:

Thank Mojang they added the recipe book, it's probably the best feature they've added {{%small%}}(even though it was in consoles first but who cares){{%/small%}}

I gathered some basic materials, made a wood pickaxe and axe, and found a nearby cave where I mined my first coals. It didn't have many things, it was half flooded and my axe broke when fighting two zombies which spawned there.

I also found the world's smallest jungle.

The mining endeavor took me almost all ingame day and soon, it was evening. Seeing as I hadn't found any sheep I did the long millenial tradition of...

## Temporal Cave Shelters

And that's where I left off my minecraft session because I had to help my mom with printing some images

Once I play again I _may_ turn these posts into a series catalouging my experiences in my first (java) world

That's it for today. Good Night!
