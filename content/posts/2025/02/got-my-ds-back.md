It's currently 4am and I can't sleep so lets write something quickly before I slumber back to bed.

So as it turns my DSi is like what, how many years old? Let me check

{{% small %}}(One wikipedia check later...){{% /small %}}

## **_[IT CAME OUT IN 2010?!?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DSi)_**

Woah it's almost 15 years old now! And it's still running!

Mine has a red case celebrating Mario's 25th anniversary, and it originally belonged to my sister before I eventually took over it. Mind you, we didn't have many games, so the only things you can do in my DS are:

1. Take photos of a school trip in 6th grade. (True story)
2. Experiment with the audio channel
3. Play the Brain Age games pre-installed there
4. ~~Play the DS Victorious shovelware using its chip~~ It got lost. Maybe for the better.
5. Play Mario Kart DS!

I used to play so much MKDS in my youth and have used several nicknames throught my karting career, some of the highlights include: [^1]

-   :3üòÄ
-   /üòÄ‚è∞Leo‚è∞üòÄ\
-   Bag pigies
-   [Undeciphrable arrangement of characters]
-   CPU0
-   KFCMan (currently using this one, obvously)

And I've even managed to get the secret title screen:

And if you're wondering, no, I haven't 3-star'd all the missions. {{< small >}}Yet...{{< /small >}}

## There's one thing missing tho

Online play.

Little couldn't figure out how to connect to the internet, and the internet configurations were too confusing for me to figure out when I was little. I mean, you're telling me that the _internet browser_ configuration is _different_ from the one MKDS uses, **_and it's a different encryption system?!?!?_**

Then a few years ago I figured out how to search stuff on the internet, so after researching a bit I found that:

1. The Mario Kart servers were shutdown
2. [Wimmfi](https://wiimmfi.de/) exists
3. Current Wifi routers are not compatible with the encryption the MKDS uses
4. You can connect your DS to a mobile hotshop with no password to access the wimmfi servers (provided you insert a especific DNS)

Back then I couldn't get it to run well, so I left it at that.

Until yesterday.

Yesterday a friend of mine showed on their whatsapp status that they were playing MKDS with a friend on their 3DS, and that inspired to try to hook the DS to the servers, so here's what I did:

## The setup

First I needed to find where I left my DS, since last time I had used it it shutdown out nowhere. Turns out it ran out of battery.

Second, I needed to check what stuff worked and what didn't. Turns out only the clock and date were reset. Cool.

Third, I searched a tutorial on how to hook up to the servers since last time I did it my myself I couldn't connect properly, so I used this tutorial in spanish:

{{< youtube k_bN1dNjU7w >}}

And it ran smoothly! But the servers I connected to were empty anyway so I couldn't play.

So if you play Mario Kart DS just contact me. We could play some matches some time.
