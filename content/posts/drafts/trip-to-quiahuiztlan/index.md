Good morning everyone! Or afternoon, or evening. Whatever your timezone strikes at when you're reading this.

I wanted to narrate the events of a holiday I took on January 4th, Sunday. On sundays entrance to the site is free, so we booked it and went there first thing in the morning. It took around an hour to drive from Veracruz, and during the trip I took many photos I wanted to share.

## Quiahuiztlan: The place of the Rain

Oh, you don't know what Quiahuiztlan is? It's a very important site regarding the history of the end of Prehispanic Mexico and its following Conquest. You know what? I'm going to leave you with what was written on the site's information board, instead. It explains everything you need to know about the site.

All information was provided the **Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH)**

> Thanks to the archeological studies conducted at this site, we know that people of Totonac affiliation used to live here. As a defensive strategy, Quiahuiztlan was settled on the Bernal Hill, also called Cerro de los Metates. The constructors of the city used terraces to avoid the soil to slide down. At the same time, they introduced walls that worked as a defensive system, making it difficult for the invaders to access. Between A. D. 800 and 900 the Toltecs invaded the city and subjugated the inhabitants. At the beginning of the 13th century, the Aztecs also conquered the city.
>
> In Quiahuiztlan, mausoleum style tombs were found. These tombs have the shape of miniature temples and they were unique in ancient Mexico. The tombs are distributed in three main cemeteries. Some members of the nobility were buried in these tombs together with beautifully fashioned ceramic offerings.
>
> Quiahuiztlan is also famous due to the fact that during the journey of Cortés, a church and a fortified enclosure were built in the nearby lowlands and small hills. This place was called "Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz", and it is considered the first Spanish settlement in Mexico. In this place an alliance with the Europeans and 30 Totonacan towns were established. This fact facilitated, one way or another, the Conquest of Mexico.
>
> You are in an unique site. Besides the exceptional tombs and the astounding architecture in the middle of the hill, historical events of vital significance ocurred in this place. We invite you to experience this place, enjoy the natural environment, and help us protect it. This Cultural Heritage site belongs to all of us.
