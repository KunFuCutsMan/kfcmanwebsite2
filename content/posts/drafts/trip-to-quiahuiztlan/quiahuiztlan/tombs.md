As mentioned on the information board, there are a lot of tombs here. What's unique about them is the fact they are shaped in the style of little houses or mausoleums. Currently there are no signs that indicate who each tomb belonged to, but I like to think they all belonged to a special someone of a family that lieved in Quiahuiztlan. Take a look at this row of tombs, for example.

Before you ask, no, they are not made from one piece. They were actually made with several stones, and smooth out using something akin to plaster! Their base is hollow, and is where the bones of the dead were most likely held, or its either because it was cheaper to build it that way. ~That's a conjecture, do not take my hypothesis seriously.~
