First of all. **What is a petate?** It's a special kind of tapestry used in Mesoamerica, woven with palm leaves and was used for ceremonial uses, denote wealth or even just as a bed. It was used everywhere for both common and special ocassions.

You can find more information in this [news article explaning its influence of mexican culture](https://www.udg.mx/es/noticia/el-petate-uno-de-los-muebles-mexicanos-mas-antiguos), or [how it was linked to power and authority](https://arqueologiamexicana.mx/mexico-antiguo/el-petate-simbolo-del-poder).

Quiahuiztlan is also called "The mount of petates" because initial archeological explorations found many of these tapestries on the site; though today you cannot see them on site because the ones that were found are either in an INAH archive, or as trophies from archeologists who weren't as professional as they should have. In hindsight, it was obvious I wasn't going to see any tepates there.

What was displayed there, were **molcajetes.** A molcajete is basically a grinder and mortar set made out of stone, used to crush spices and the like. They're most commonly decorated to have the head of a pig on one side, because it's cute that way.

Some molcajetes that were found on the site are shown on the image above, though I have to apologize for not photographing them in detail.
