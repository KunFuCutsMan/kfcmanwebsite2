Quiahuiztlan was the first settlement to see Cortes' ships, and their alliance with his armies, along with the rest of the Totonacan towns would sign the fate of the country.

Do you imagine being a gardener cleaning the tombs of your nobles, and seeing from **THIS** view a huge structure landing on the beach, and a few days later the men that came out of the sea knock on your door? I would be terrified, if you ask me.

Today Villa Rica's beaches are a tourist attraction, where you can walk up La Quebrada for some stunning views, fishing spots, or pay a ferry boat to guide you to the Amarradero.
